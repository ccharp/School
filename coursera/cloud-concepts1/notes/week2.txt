Week 2: Gossip
Multicast Problem:
    - Multicast: want to get information from single node to other computers. (think PC talking to NY stock exchange
    - Requires FALT-TOLERANCE and SCALABILITYlk
    - multicast protocal often sits at application layer
    - Centralized Approach
        - UDP/TCP packet -- simplest implimentation
        - problems
            - if sender fails halfway sending info to all nodes, many nodes will not receive info
            - large burden on sender (resonsible for sending imfornation to all nodes
    - Tree-Based
        - UDP/TCP packet 
        - tree can remain balanced. 
        - each node passes message along to adjacdnet nodes
        - Problem: 
            - need to set up and maintain the tree
            - falures near root of tree can cause large number of nodes to not receive message
        - build spanning tree among the processes of multicast group
        - use ACKs or NACKs to repaire multicasts not received
        - SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast) -- uses NACKS
        - RMTP (Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol) -- uses ACKS
            - re-transmit messages not ACKed
        - still have O(N) scalable
