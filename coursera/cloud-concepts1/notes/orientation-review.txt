ORIENTATION LECTURE -- REVIEW
1. basic datastructures
    - queue: first in, first 
        - instert and removal are concurrent
    - stack: first in, last out
        - insert and removal cannot be concurrent
2. processes: program in action
    - parts of process
        - code, stack, program counter, heap and registers
        - each thread contains it's own stack 
3. computer architecture
    - cpu, registers, cache, memory, disk (in decreasing locality)
    - cpu loads instructions in batches
4. big O notation
    - describes the upper bound behavior of the algorithm
    - worst-case performance
5. basic proability
    - set: collection of things
    - subset: a collection of things that are part of a larger set
    - for independent events, multiply them together to get the net probability
        - if events are dependent, can't do this
    - OR: prob(E1 OR E2) = prob(E1) + prob(E2) - prob(E1 AND E2)
6. DNS
    - DNS = Domain Name System
    - collection of servers throughout the workd
    - input: URL
    - returns IP address of server that actually hosts the content
    - IP may be server actually hosting the contnent or an indirection server (Content Distribution Server)
7. Graphs
    - vocab: edge, edge weight, node, vertex, adjacent
