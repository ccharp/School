What is cloud?
    - a cluster? a super computer? a datastore?
    - no single, perfect definition
    - for our purposes: lot sof storage + compute cycles nearby
        - very data intensive
    - single-site cloud (data center)
        - computer nodes grouped into racks
        - software servies (think CReSIS
                                switch
            top of rack switch            ...
       rack1      rack2      rack3   ... ... ... ...
    - distributed cloud
        - multiple such sites, each with perhaps structure
