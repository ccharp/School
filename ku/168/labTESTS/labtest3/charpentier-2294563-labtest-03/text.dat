A programming language is an artificial language designed to express computations that can be performed by a machine particularly 
a computer Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine to express algorithms 
precisely or as a mode of human communication

Many programming languages have some form of written specification of their syntax form and semantics meaning 
Some languages are defined by a specification document For example the C programming language is specified by 
an ISO Standard Other languages such as Perl have a dominant implementation that is used as a reference

The earliest programming languages predate the invention of the computer and were used to direct the behavior of machines 
such as Jacquard looms and player pianos Thousands of different programming languages have been created mainly in the computer 
field with many more being created every year Most programming languages describe computation in an imperative style for example 
as a sequence of commands although some languages such as those that support functional programming or logic programming use 
alternative forms of description
