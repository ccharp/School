1. If the duration is too small, we won't see a change because it hasn't had a 
chance to happen yet. In other words, we might see false positives for deadlocks,
but false negatives will never happen. 

2. As hinted at in the previous question, the method used to detecting deadlocks 
in this program would be most effective on a singlethreaded system. This is because
this system will only be executing our program and not away running other processes. 
So, to answer the question, for best resultsthe busier the system with other processes, 
the longer the sampling time.

3. It's true but for the wrong reasons. A shorter ACTIVE_DURATION gives a higher 
chance for false positives like the cases mentioned above.
