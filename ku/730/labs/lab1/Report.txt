REPORT -- 
	The collected data supports the claim made by the Law of Lage numbers: as the size
of the random sample n increases, n's average converges with the average of the entire
set. For binomial distrubition, this means that the average will converge on
E[X] = n*p, where n is the random sample size and p is the Poission parameter. The 
normal distribution average converged on the overall average, µ, since the Gaussian 
curve is centered around it.
